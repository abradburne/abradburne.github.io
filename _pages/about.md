Hi, I'm Alan, a web application developer and consultant living in Reading, near London, UK and sometimes Kumamoto, Japan.

I work primarily with Ruby and Rails, developing with Rails since the first release in 2004.

I'm the author of the book 'Rails 5 Revealed', the very out-of-date 'Practical Rails Social Networking Sites' (for Rails 1.2!) and the upcoming 'Practical Rails 5' (due at the end of 2016).

You can email me at <alan@alanbradburne.com>
